Matlab-based GUI design
Imitating ANSYS Motor-CAD software, using MATLAB APP Designer to make the motor simulation and analysis software GUI, we have now achieved 2D and 3D drawing of surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors, calculation of air-gap magnetism, counterpotential, per-phase magnetic chain, cogging torque, electromagnetic torque, and interface design.
